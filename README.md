# Animation Assignment


I used anime.js. I played around with a couple of different animations. I 
made the words in the header "Welcome to our Bookstore" arrange themselves
on load. I made the logo roll slowly back and forth at the top of the screen.
And I made it so that when you hover over the news and calendar sections, 
they shift to the side and flash a gray color.
